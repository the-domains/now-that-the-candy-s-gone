How I Learned About Life Success

If you had told me when I was growing up that I would be
helping women,  I would have told you that you were crazy . . .  

I was
born in Sicily (Italy).  My parents lived
a very simple life in Sicily.  They
wanted a better life for my sister.  When
I was three years old, they immigrated to Canada.  Neither of my parents had any formal
education, in fact my mother only went to grade 5, and that was only because
social services threatened my grandmother that if she didn't send my mother to
school they would take her away.  Neither
my mother nor my father spoke any English.  To this day, I have no idea how my parents managed to get me enrolled in
school, but they did.  I hated
school.  I was miserable the whole
time because I couldn't speak English.  When I finally learned to speak some English, I had to deal with the fact that we spoke Sicilian at home.  I ended up mixing up the two languages up, then no one understood me, not even my
parents.  The theme of my report cards
was "nice kid, isn't going to amount to much".  It's hard not to believe that when you hear it over and over.  My mom, bless her, didn't know what to do.  She was smart though, smarter than I ever
gave her credit for growing up.  One day,
she sent me to school with candy.  She
loaded me up so that I would have enough to share.  She knew that children loved candy and that if
I shared my candy, I would make friends.  It was a great idea and worked like a charm . . . until the candy ran
out, then my so-called "friends" were gone.  I realized at that point that my parents weren't going to be able to
help me.  I was on my own.

I didn't know it at the time, but I was on
my way to becoming a master of success.  For me it was about survival, but I
realize now how other women get stuck.   It broke my heart to see amazing women struggle.  I had to do something, so I've
dedicated myself to making a difference by sharing what I've learned along the way and how I
overcame all the roadblocks that I encountered.

I'm hoping that my stories will help women realize that the only thing
holding them back from unlimited success, is themselves.
