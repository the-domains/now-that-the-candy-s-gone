<p>Caterina Perry - Coach, Trainer and Writer</p><p>If you had told me when I was growing up that I would be
helping women become more successful in their personal, career and business lives, I would have told you that you were crazy . . . </p><p>You see, I was
born in Sicily into a very poor simple family.  My parents wanted a better life for my sister and I so when I was three years old, we immigrated to Canada.</p><p>My parents didn't have formal
education.  In fact, my mother only went to grade 5, and that was only because
social services threatened my grandmother that if she didn't send my mother to
school they would take her away.  Neither
my mother nor father spoke any English.  To this day, I have no idea how they managed to get me enrolled in
school, but they did.</p><p>I hated
school.  I couldn't English so I couldn't speak or understand
anyone.  When I learned some English I ended up mixing it with Sicilian, then not even my parents understood me.  The theme of my report cards
was “nice kid, isn't going to amount to much”.  I heard that so often that I grew up believing it.</p><p>My mom, bless her, didn't know what to do.  She was smart though, smarter than I ever
gave her credit for growing up.  One day,
she sent me to school with candy.  She
loaded me up so that I would have enough to share.  She knew that children loved candy and that if
I shared my candy, I would make friends.  It was a great idea and worked like a charm . . . until the candy ran
out, then my so-called “friends” were gone.</p><p>I realized that my parents weren't going to be able to
help me.  I was on my own.  I didn't know it at the time, but I was on
my way to becoming a master at figuring out how life worked.  For me it was all about survival, but I
realize now how much what learned impacted the success that I've had in my life.  </p><p>It broke my heart to see amazing women not realize how amazing they were.  I had to do something, so I dedicated myself to making a difference by sharing what I’ve learned and how I
overcame all the roadblocks that I encountered.  I'm hoping that my stories will help women realize that the only thing
holding them back from unlimited success, is themselves.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
